They are viewing Python code (specifically `_capture.py`) and observing real-time output in the integrated terminal, which shows information related to `implementation_summary.md` and \"Running Gemini-2.5-flash\". Concurrently, the user is monitoring system processes and potential errors through a dedicated \"Run code and check for errors\" panel, which provides details on terminating processes using `pkill` commands.\n*   **Simultaneous Communication:** In the second image, the user is engaged in a messaging application, likely Microsoft Teams, where they are actively chatting with a contact named \"darrynne\".\n*   **Updating Debugging Status:** The user explicitly sends a message to \"darrynne\" stating, \"I am deep in the debugging\", directly indicating their current task and linking the debugging activity from the first image to their communication.\n*   **Collaborative Design Discussion:** The conversation with \"darrynne\" includes mentions of \"design decisions,\" \"GOAL SETTING,\" and specific decision points related to \"generate propositions,\" suggesting a collaborative development environment where the user is debugging code that is part of a larger project involving shared design choices.\n*   **Task Coordination:** The user also sends a message to \"darrynne\" asking them to \"try checking in for me when u leave,\" indicating coordination of tasks or responsibilities.",

The influence of 'getting distracted by notifications' during the '2 hours' of procrastination is also explicitly stated.",

The sequence 'User opened VS Code and started coding Python', 'User switched to browser and opened YouTube', and 'User returned to VS Code and continued coding' occurring within an 'extremely compressed timeframe of approximately 0.000592 seconds' provides explicit evidence of very brief, possibly unintentional, shifts to other applications from which Eyrin swiftly re-engages with the primary task, distinct from prolonged distraction.",

The user is actively reviewing problem outputs and terminal logs, which show \"INFO Processing batch of 5 observations\" messages, suggesting that batch operations are running or being debugged.\n\n2.  **Addressing System Processes:** In a dedicated panel titled \"Run code and check for errors\" within VS Code, the user is presented with suggestions for terminating processes related to `gum.cli` using `pkill` and `ps aux | grep` commands. This indicates a need to manage or restart parts of the running system.\n\n3.  **Monitoring and Debugging Batch Processing:** The user interacts with a sidebar in VS Code titled \"Add batch processing monitoring,\" which lists \"decision steps\" and options to \"Create debug logger\" and \"Add debug logging to gum.py for batch processing steps.\" This suggests a focus on understanding and tracing the flow of data and decisions within their batch processing system.\n\n4.  **Receiving Behavioral Nudges:** Throughout their work in VS Code, the user is receiving \"GUM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\" via a \"Problems\" panel and a separate \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" application window. These nudges are context-aware, for example, suggesting to return to \"customNudg batcher logic\" if the user switches to a \"generic Google search\" or advising against distraction when in a \"highly focused work state.\"\n\n5.  **Communicating via Messaging Application:** The user is actively using a messaging application (resembling Google Chat) to communicate with multiple contacts. Conversations include personal updates (\"Awesome lemme finish debugging and then look over...\") and social interactions (\"Fun Car?!?\", \"rage cage?\").\n\n6.  **Web Browsing and AI Development:** The user has multiple browser tabs open, including a standard Google search page and \"Google AI Studio\" (visible in multiple images). This suggests a combination of research and interaction with AI development tools or APIs.\n\nHere are the bullet points referencing specific user actions:\n\n*   The user is **editing and debugging Python code** in `state_capture.py` within VS Code, focusing on `async` functions and `self.batcher.start()` calls for batch processing (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **reviews terminal output and problem reports** in VS Code, specifically observing \"INFO Processing batch of 5 observations\" and \"GUM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" messages (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **engages with debugging tools and suggestions** in VS Code, including a panel for \"Run code and check for errors\" that offers `pkill` commands for `gum.cli` processes, and a sidebar for \"Add batch processing monitoring\" (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **responds to and views behavioral nudges** from the \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" system, which provides context-aware advice related to task focus and transitions (Image 2, 7, 8).\n*   The user **communicates via a messaging application**, sending and receiving messages related to both work (\"lemme finish debugging\") and personal topics (\"Fun Car?!?\") (Image 3, 5).\n*   The user has **multiple web browser tabs open**, including a Google search page and Google AI Studio, indicating concurrent browsing and interaction with AI-related services (Image 3, 4, 5, 8).",

Explicit evidence for brief, self-corrected shifts is noted, such as a switch to `YouTube` for 'approximately 0.000592 seconds' before returning to `VS Code` (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4). Crucially, the `GUM Notifications - Eyrin` application explicitly flags this behavior: a 'SENT - PRODUCTIVITY' nudge states 'Eyrin transitioned from focused Python development on 'customNudgJ' batch processing to a generic Gocogle search' (Screenshot 2, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), indicating a recognized pattern.

Eyrin's multi-application environment is consistently observed, with rapid switches between `Visual Studio Code` (for coding/debugging), the `Messages` application (communicating with `Darynne` and `mom`), and `Google Chrome` (for `AI consultation`, `Google Search` for 'mess', `YouTube`) within compressed timeframes (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4 & 6th set of observations). Explicit evidence for brief, self-corrected shifts is noted, such as a switch to `YouTube` for 'approximately 0.000592 seconds' before returning to `VS Code` (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4). Crucially, the `GUM Notifications - Eyrin` application explicitly flags this behavior: a 'SENT - PRODUCTIVITY' nudge states 'Eyrin transitioned from focused Python development on 'customNudgJ' batch processing to a generic Gocogle search' (Screenshot 2, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), indicating a recognized pattern. Conversely, `X NOT SENT` notifications are recorded when Eyrin is in a 'highly focused work state' within `VS Code` (Screenshot 1, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), confirming the system's role in managing these transitions.",

Several other Python and YAML files are open as tabs, including `ilm_judge.py` and `deploy-docs.yml`. The left sidebar shows a project explorer labeled \"CUSTOMNUDGE\" with various directories and files. The bottom panel's \"OUTPUT\" tab is active, displaying numerous `INFO` messages related to a \"notifications-model 'gemini-2.5-flash'\", suggesting the user is monitoring a running process or reviewing build/runtime logs. The code window for `notifier.py` shows highlighted lines (515-519) within a `print` statement, indicating a potential point of interest or recent modification.\n\n*   **Transition to a New Project/Debugging (Image 2):** The user has switched context, likely opening a new workspace or project. The previous open tabs are replaced with files related to a project named \"hw6_bayesian\", with `submission.py` currently active and in focus. The left sidebar now displays the `hw6_bayesian` project structure. The bottom panel's \"TERMINAL\" tab is active, showing a traceback indicating an error. Specifically, an `Exception: browm <cli:Exception> -- Not implemented yet` occurred, pointing to line 435 in `submission.py`, likely within an `em_learn` function, and referencing `grader.py`. This suggests the user is in the process of developing or debugging an assignment or task, and a test run has failed because a required part of their code is not yet implemented.\n\n**Specific actions the user is taking:**\n\n*   **Monitoring System Output:** In the first image, the user is reviewing the \"OUTPUT\" panel, which displays system information and logs, possibly from a running application or a build process involving a \"gemini-2.5-flash\" model.\n*   **Navigating Code:** The user has `notifier.py` open and focused in the first image, and then `submission.py` in the second, indicating they are navigating between different code files relevant to their current tasks.\n*   **Debugging/Testing Code:** In the second image, the user is observing the \"TERMINAL\" output, which shows a failed test run due to a \"Not implemented yet\" exception in their `submission.py` file, indicating they are in the process of developing and testing a solution.",

(page 2)\nWhat is the shape of the counts table for such a node? It will be `tuple(parent_domains_lengths) + (current_node_domain_length)`.\n\n**Browser Content (Main Body):**\nBayesian network for annotator labels\n1. Check if the node is observed. Is `node_name` in the `assignment_id` dictionary? If not, you can't accumulate counts for it (it's unobserved).\n2. Get the node's value: What value does this node take in this assignment? How do you convert that value to an index in the node's domain?\n3. Handle parents:\n    *   If the node has no parents, where in `counts[node_name]` should you add the weight? (Hint: remember the batch dimension and the `idx` variable)\n    *   If the node has parents, you need to figure out which parent configuration this is. Look at the helper method `node_parent_assignment_indices(assignment_i)` \u2013 what does it return?\n4. Update the counts: Add `weight` to the appropriate location in `counts[node_name]`.\n    *   Key questions to ask yourself:\n        *   For a root node (no parents), what's the shape of its counts table?\n        *   For a node with parents, what indices do you need to properly index into the counts table?\n        *   Where does `idx` (the batch index) fit into this indexing?\n    *   `mle_estimation` hints:\n        *   Think about the MLE process.\n        *   1.

The code block for `accumulate_assignment` is visible, along with comments indicating \"BEGIN_CODE\" and \"END_CODE\" where user implementation is expected.\n*   **Observing and Responding to Errors (Image 3, 4):** The terminal output in VS Code (Image 3 and 4) clearly shows a `NotImplementedError` originating from `submission.py`, specifically at line 435 within an `em_learn` function and line 694. This indicates that a required part of the code has not yet been implemented or has been explicitly marked as not implemented.\n*   **Consulting AI for Instructions and Hints (Image 2, 5):** The user switches to a web browser to consult a Claude AI chat interface.\n    *   In **Image 2**, the user is reading high-level instructions for a \"Bayesian network for annotator labels\" assignment, covering steps 1-4 for updating counts.\n    *   In **Image 5**, the user has expanded the \"mle_estimation hints\" section within the Claude AI chat, which provides more specific guidance for implementation, including \"Initialize counts\", \"Add smoothing\", and \"Accumulate data\". This suggests the user is looking for guidance to resolve the `NotImplementedError` encountered in their code.\n\nIn essence, the user is iterating between coding in VS Code, encountering an error (due to unimplemented code), and then seeking guidance from a Claude AI chat to understand how to implement the missing functionality and resolve the error.",

Sonnet 4.5,' suggesting Eyrin is consulting an `AI model (like Claude)` for explanations or code related to the `batcher`'s `start()` method.

The sequence shows observation of notification decisions, a shift to email activity, and then debugging or monitoring the notification system's underlying code and output.\n\nHere are the specific actions observed:\n\n*   **Image 1:** The user is viewing the \"GUM Behavioral Nudges\" application, which displays \"25 new decisions\". A \"Notification Decisions\" overlay shows three recent decisions, all indicating \"NOT SENT - NONE\". The reasoning for these decisions is visible, primarily concerning \"Eyrin's goal to focus on coding\" and avoiding notification fatigue. Simultaneously, the user has a Chrome browser open, displaying a \"Career Closet Tomorrow!\" email in an Outlook tab.\n*   **Image 2:** The user has dismissed or closed the \"Notification Decisions\" overlay in the \"GUM Behavioral Nudges\" application, which now shows \"221\" decisions instead of 25. In the Chrome browser, the user has navigated from viewing a specific email to the main Outlook inbox, where the \"Career Closet Tomorrow!\" email is visible in the list.\n*   **Image 3:** The user has switched applications to a code editor (VS Code), where the file `notifier.py` is open. The terminal pane at the bottom displays \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" with \"Should Notify: NO,\" indicating a decision not to send a notification based on \"Eyrin currently actively engaged in coding within VS Code, specifically working on 'notifier.py'\".\n*   **Image 4:** While still in the code editor, the \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" output in the terminal has updated. It now states \"Should Notify: YES\" with a \"Type: Focus,\" and the reasoning has changed to reflect \"Eyrin switching from the code editor to Outlook, which is a clear deviation from the goal.\" An `AttributeError` related to `deliverNotification_` is also visible, suggesting an issue with the notification delivery mechanism.\n*   **Image 5:** The user continues to observe the code editor and its terminal output. The \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" remains \"Should Notify: YES,\" and the `AttributeError` persists. Log messages related to processing observations and making decisions continue to scroll in the terminal.\n*   **Image 6:** The user has scrolled within the `notifier.py` file in the code editor, now viewing the `_update_satisfaction_multiplier` function. The terminal output still shows the \"Should Notify: YES\" decision and the `AttributeError`, with updated log entries including a \"WARNING: New decision\". This indicates ongoing system activity while the user examines different parts of the code.",

An overlay window titled \"GUM Behavioral Nudges\" is displayed, indicating \"15 new decision(s)\". Below this, a smaller \"Notification Decision\" overlay is visible, outlining a \"Reasoning\" for a potential nudge: \"Eyrin's goal is to focus on coding, and checking email directly hinders this.\" The option \"NOT SENT - NONE\" is selected.\n*   **Expanded Nudges (Image 2):** The \"GUM Behavioral Nudges\" interface has expanded to show three individual \"Notification Decision\" boxes. Each box presents a different \"Reasoning\" for a potential nudge based on the user's observed activity (e.g., \"Eyrin is currently actively engaged in coding within VS Code, specifically working on 'notifier.py'\", \"Eyrin is currently in VS Code, actively coding, which aligns perfectly with her session goal to 'focus on coding!'\"). For all three decisions, \"NOT SENT - NONE\" remains selected.\n*   **Outlook Restored (Image 3):** The \"GUM Behavioral Nudges\" overlay and its associated notification decision windows are no longer present on the screen. The user is now viewing the full Microsoft Outlook interface, displaying the email content for \"Career Closet Tomorrow!\"\n*   **VS Code Output (Image 4):** The user has switched to a VS Code window. The terminal output is visible, displaying a \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\". In this instance, the system has determined \"Should Notify: No\", explaining that \"Eyrin is currently browsing email, which is a clear deviation from the goal to 'focus on coding!'\"\n*   **Decision Change (Image 5):** The VS Code terminal output has updated. The \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" now indicates \"Should Notify: Yes\". An `AttributeError` is visible in the output, specifically related to `deliverNotification_`. Multiple \"INFO\" messages detail the process of generating notifications, processing observations, and updating the screen.\n*   **Warning and Detailed Decision (Image 6):** The VS Code terminal output has further updated. The \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" still shows \"Should Notify: Yes\". A \"WARNING: New decision\" is highlighted, and a detailed \"LLM decision\" provides a comprehensive explanation for why a nudge *should* be sent: \"Eyrin is currently focused on coding in VS Code, directly fulfilling the session's goal to v focus on coding! Sending a notification now would be d isruptive and redundant, as Eyrin is already engaged in the desired behavior. The terminal output pertains to a past, not current, observation about YouTube, however, and the LLM has made an additional decision, which is not reflected in the current terminal output. The current observation shows Eyrin actually engaged in VS Code...\" The output also contains a large volume of \"INFO\" messages regarding system activity and background processes.",

The system indicates an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" of \"NO\" for sending a notification, reasoning that the user (Eyirin) is focused on coding and an email would be a distraction. No notification is sent at this time.\n*   The user then **switches applications** to Outlook, where they **view** an email titled \"Career Closet Tomorrow!\" in their inbox.\n*   While in Outlook, the user **observes** two pop-up windows from \"GUM Behavioral Nudges.\" These pop-ups display \"Notification Decisions\" that indicate \"X NOT SENT - NONE,\" with reasoning related to the user's coding focus and the disruptive nature of notifications when engaged in VS Code.\n*   After the pop-ups are dismissed, the user continues **viewing** the \"Career Closet Tomorrow!\" email in Outlook.\n*   The user then **switches back** to the VS Code environment, where they continue to **observe** the terminal output. The GUM system's \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" reiterates \"NO\" for sending a notification, consistent with the user being in Outlook and that activity being a deviation from the coding goal.\n*   Later, the user continues to **observe** the VS Code terminal as the GUM system's \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" changes to \"YES\" for a \"Focus\" type notification. The system's reasoning now suggests that the user (Eyirin) is in Outlook, and a notification to \"Return to coding, aligning with Eyirin's stated goal\" is appropriate. However, the logs immediately show an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'deliverNotification_'`, indicating an issue in delivering the intended notification.\n*   The user continues **observing** the VS Code terminal, where the `AttributeError` related to notification delivery persists, despite the GUM system having decided to send a notification.

This demonstrates the active execution, monitoring, and debugging of a system that processes user observations and infers goals. Furthermore, the 'GUM Notifications - Eyrin' application directly presents 'GUM Behavioral Nudges' and 'Notification Decisions', detailing the system's reasoning based on Eyrin's activities.",

This application displays \"customNudge Decisions,\" detailing \"Reasoning\" and \"Observation\" for various productivity nudges.\n*   A web browser tab showing a calendar application, displaying scheduled events for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (13th-15th).\n\nSubsequently (Image 2), the user has shifted their focus within the development environment and browser:\n*   The \"GUM Notifications\" application is no longer visible. Instead, the user is now viewing `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` within the Python IDE, which outlines the steps for setting up a \"CustomNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine.\"\n*   A terminal window is open at the bottom of the IDE, displaying command-line interactions. The user has navigated to a directory `/Users/eyrin/Documents/CustomNudge` and seemingly executed a command related to a `notifier` file.\n*   The web browser content has changed from the calendar to an administrative interface for a \"notifier\" system. This interface presents options for \"Implement macOS banner notifications for nudges,\" \"Monitoring,\" and \"Testing the Swift notifier directly,\" alongside a section to \"Review Changes.\"\n\nSpecific actions the user appears to be taking:\n*   The user **switched the active document** within their Python development environment, moving from the \"GUM Notifications\" display to the `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.\n*   The user **interacted with the command line** by opening or bringing a terminal window into focus and navigating to a specific project directory (`cd /Users/eyrin/Documents/CustomNudge`).\n*   The user **navigated to a different web page or switched browser tabs** to view the \"notifier\" system's administrative interface, moving away from the calendar application.",

Simultaneously, a calendar view, possibly from a web browser or a dedicated application, is open on the right side of the screen, displaying a weekly schedule spanning November 13th to 15th.\n\nIn the second image, the user has switched their active application. A Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window is now in the foreground, obscuring the \"customNudge Decisions\" application and partially covering the previously visible calendar.

A terminal panel is also visible at the bottom of the VS Code window, showing command-line interactions and output, likely related to testing a `swift_notifier`. The calendar remains open but is now in the background behind the VS Code window.\n\nHere are the specific actions:\n\n*   The user *switches the active application* from the \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" window (displaying \"customNudge Decisions\" in Image 1) to a Visual Studio Code window (Image 2).\n*   Within the active Visual Studio Code window, the user *opens and views the `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file* (visible in the main editor pane in Image 2), which details the setup process for the \"customNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine.\"\n*   The user *observes the output in the integrated terminal* within Visual Studio Code (bottom of Image 2), which shows commands and results related to testing the `/notifier_swift_notifier`.",

Previous nudges to integrate Claude's explanations were highly effective. A full day has passed since similar notifications, and Claude has now explained a new, deeper concept (\"counts structure\"). Recording this will immediately apply this understanding to their code will reinforce learning and aid debugging, leveraging a proven effective strategy.\nObservation: Here is a markdown transcription of the content from the screenshots:\n### Chrome Browser\n\"Top Bar...\nContext: [2] generated | 14 similar propositions | 5 similar observations\n\n**Content Section 2**\nX NOT SENT - NONE - 03:23:09 PM\nReasoning: Eyrin is currently consuming a detailed explanation from Claude about Python code, which is highly relevant to their ongoing development work. While this presents a good opportunity for a productivity nudge to encourage active integration of the AI's explanation, a previous notification was sent just 27 seconds ago (at 15:18:23).

Therefore, despite the high potential relevance and actionability, a notification should not be sent at this time.\nObservation: **Chrome Browser - Top Bar**\n**Tabs (Left to Right):**\nFile\nEdit\nView\nContext: | 12 generated | 14 similar propositions | 5 similar observations\n\n**Decision 3 (Red Box):**\nX NOT SENT - NONE - 03:22:51 PM\n\n**macOS Dock (Bottom Bar):**\nFinder, Safari, Messages, Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Photos, Maps, App Store, Settings, Visual Studio Code, Terminal, Zoom, Music, Search icon.\nDate & Time: Mon Oct 16 10:53 PM\n\n---\n\n**Screenshot 2 (Right Screen - Code Editor and Calendar)**\n\n**macOS Menu Bar:**\n\u2318 0 \u2756 X + Wed Nov 12 10:10:53 PM\n\n**Code Editor Window (Left Half of Screen):**\n**Application Title Bar:** customNudge\n\n**File Explorer (Left Sidebar):**\nCUSTOMNUDGE\nnotifier_swift_notifier\n.build.sh\ninfo.plist\nmac_notifier\nmac_notifier.swift\ntests\ncleanup_database.py\ndebug_batch_processing.py\ndebug_notification_steps.py\nmonitor_batch.py\nsimple_monitor.py\nsimple_test.py\ntest_batch_debug.py\ntest_batcher.py\ntest_notification.py\ntest_notifications.py\ntest_notifier.py\ntrace_batch_flow.py\n.gitignore\ndebug_queue.py\nIMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md\nLICENSE\nmkdocs.yml\nnotification_contexts_eyrin.json\nnotification_contexts_test_user.json\nnotification_decisions_darren.json\nnotification_decisions_eyrin.json\nnotification_decisions_test_user.json\nnotification_gui.py\npip-update.sh\npyproject.toml\nREADME.md\nSETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md\nsetup.py\nskylpot-tmp.yml\n\n**Editor Content (Main Area):**\nSETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md x state_capture.py training_logger.py\n\\# SETUP\\_INSTRUCTIONS.md > \\# setup instructions for customNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine > \\#\n\\#\\# \\# Setup Instructions for customNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine\n\\#\\# \\# 1.

The top notification, labeled \"Bent - Productivity,\" includes text about complex code logic and improving productivity. A second, \"Not Sent - None,\" notification is visible below. Other applications visible include a Python IDE (IDLE), \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin,\" and a calendar showing a weekly schedule.\n\n**Image 2 (Transition and Focus Shift):**\nThe user has closed or minimized the \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" and \"customNudge Decisions\" windows, as well as other application windows (\"interactive macOS...\", \"MTFpresentation...\"). The calendar is still open but is now largely obscured by a prominent code editor window (likely VS Code).\n\nWithin the code editor:\n*   The user has multiple files open, including `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (which is currently active) and `notifier.py`.\n*   The `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file details steps for setting up the \"customNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine,\" including model selection and notification GUI setup.\n*   An integrated terminal is visible at the bottom, showing command-line interactions.\n\n**Specific Actions Occurring:**\n\n*   **Viewing Notifications:** In Image 1, the user is observing the output of a \"customNudge Decisions\" application, which presents productivity-related nudges.\n*   **Shifting Focus to Development Environment:** The user transitions from viewing the notification output to interacting with a code editor, indicating a shift towards developing or debugging the system that generates these notifications.\n*   **Executing Python Script:** In the terminal within the code editor, the user explicitly runs the command `python notifier_gui.py Eyrin`. This suggests they are launching the graphical user interface for the notification system.\n*   **Attempting Notification Send and Encountering Error:** The user then attempts to trigger a notification using `./mac_notifier \"00 Test\"`, which results in an \"authorization\" error. This indicates the user is testing the notification sending functionality and encountering a permission issue.\n*   **Reviewing Setup Instructions:** The user is viewing the `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file, which includes steps for \"Implement macOS banner notifications for nudges\" and notes about obtaining macOS notification permissions, directly relevant to the error encountered.",

The left screen shows different applications in each image.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the actions:\n\n*   **Image 1:** The user has a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE), possibly VS Code, open on the left screen. Within the IDE, they are viewing a window titled \"customNudge Decisions\" which displays two \"GUM Notification - Eyrin\" alerts, likely related to productivity nudges.\n*   **Image 2:** The user has switched their focus within the Python IDE on the left screen. They are now viewing a markdown file named `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, which contains setup instructions for a \"CustomNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine\". A terminal window is open at the bottom of the IDE, displaying commands related to `cd notifier/swift_notifier` and `mac_notifier` executions.\n*   **Image 3:** The user has switched the active application on the left screen from the Python IDE to Microsoft Word. They are viewing a document titled \"Autumn 2025-UE-HW6-2\", displaying homework content related to energy calculations, CO2 emissions, and environmental issues.\n\nIn summary, the user's primary actions involve:\n*   **Switching views within a Python IDE** from an application output/log (`customNudge Decisions`) to a documentation file (`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) and interacting with a terminal.\n*   **Switching the active application on the left screen** from the Python IDE to Microsoft Word to view a homework document.\n*   **Maintaining a persistent view** of a calendar application and web browser tabs on the right screen throughout these changes.",

This application displays log-like entries, one marked \"\u2713 BENT - PRODUCTIVITY - 03:23:29 PM\" which mentions \"Claude's 'counts structure' explanation\" and \"Eyrin is learning complex logic code from Claude,\" suggesting a system for logging or guiding productivity decisions. For the duration of these three images, the application remains in the foreground without any visible changes, indicating a period of reading or contemplation.\n*   **Transition to Code Editor (Image 4):** The user then switches their active application to **Visual Studio Code**. They are viewing a file named `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` within a `CUSTOMNUDGE` project, which details steps for setting up the \"customNudge Adaptive Nudge Engine.\" A terminal window is also open at the bottom, displaying output from a `swift_notifier` script.\n*   **Transition to Document Editor (Images 5-6):** Finally, the user switches to **Microsoft Word**. They are reviewing or editing a document titled \"Autumn 2025-UE-HW6-2,\" which appears to be a homework assignment involving calculations related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The cursor is visible at the end of the sentence \"One potential environmental prob\" in Image 5, and the document scrolls slightly in Image 6 while the cursor remains in the same area.\n\n**Key Actions:**\n\n*   **Reviewing System Logs/Decisions:** The user is *reading* content within the \"customNudge Decisions\" application, specifically the log entries about \"Eyrin learning complex logic code.\"\n*   **Working on Project Setup/Code:** The user *opened* and *viewed* `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in Visual Studio Code, which implies they are either setting up the `customNudge` project or reviewing its setup. They are also *monitoring* command-line output in the integrated terminal.\n*   **Editing/Reviewing a Document:** The user *interacted with* a Microsoft Word document, likely *typing* or *reviewing* content related to environmental calculations on page 6 of a homework assignment.\n*   **Multitasking with Calendar:** Throughout all observed actions, the user has a **Google Calendar** tab *open* in a web browser on the right side of the screen, displaying a weekly view for Thursday 14 and Friday 15, indicating general awareness of their schedule.",

This demonstrates the active execution, monitoring, and debugging of a system that processes user observations and infers goals.

The `macOS Menu Bar` timestamps consistently display times between `Thu Nov 13 12:45:23 AM` and `Thu Nov 13 12:48:50 AM`. This early morning timing (in Eyrin's local time zone) combined with the swift, unbroken content consumption pattern suggests that Eyrin is performing a routine, brief check-in on social media, possibly as a quick start to their day, a short break, or a late-night activity, rather than a dedicated, lengthy browsing session.",

The session begins with the user viewing posts on their main feed and then transitions to browsing various video Reels.\n\nHere's a detailed description of the actions:\n\n*   **Initial Feed View:** The user begins by viewing an Instagram post on their home feed. This first post features Angelina Jolie and discusses a past personal struggle related to hiring a hitman.\n*   **Scrolling/Navigation on Feed:** The user then scrolls or navigates to a subsequent post on their home feed. This post includes text about \"jacob elordi\" and a linked post from \"DiscussingFilm\" comparing Jacob Elordi and Andrew Garfield in the context of \"Frankenstein.\"\n*   **Navigating to Reels:** The user transitions from the main feed to the \"Reels\" section of Instagram. This is evident by the change in the URL to `instagram.com/reels/...` and the \"Reels\" icon becoming highlighted in the left navigation panel.\n*   **Viewing Multiple Reels:** Once in the \"Reels\" section, the user proceeds to view several different video Reels. These include a reel of a woman speaking, a reel of a man in a tuxedo with the text \"For once in my life,\" a reel showing a man at a food stall preparing food, and a reel featuring a man walking down stairs with the caption \"pov: your roommate is chatgpt.\"\n*   **Continued Reel Engagement:** The user appears to watch the \"pov: your roommate is chatgpt\" reel for a brief duration, as two subsequent screenshots show slightly different frames of the same video content (the man walking further down the stairs).",

A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

This dynamic movement between distinct types of tasks (coding, social communication, AI research) is a clear pattern of rapid context switching.

This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

This dynamic movement between distinct types of tasks (coding, social communication, AI research) is a clear pattern of rapid context switching. The `customnudge` system's 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' log at 5:50 PM explicitly identifies this behavior, noting 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work',' and that a previous 'notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago).'",

In the integrated terminal/output panel, Python code related to a \"gemini-2.5-flash\" model is executing, with logs indicating various `INFO` messages like \"getting code project to work\" and \"Started batch.\" A side panel shows \"async notification fallback issues\" and a \"queue batch\" status.\n*   The user switches to their email client (Apple Mail) and reviews an ongoing conversation with 'karen vo' where new messages about 'ski passes' and 'locked dates' are visible, sent around 5:47 PM. Another message from 'karen vo' appears at 5:48 PM asking \"You used Estellas last yr?\".\n*   The user then navigates to a browser tab displaying the Claude AI interface, specifically a chat titled 'Swift notification system batch processing issue'. Within this interface, the user views a scheduling pop-up with several time entries, highlighting the '5:48 PM - 11:48 PM' slot.\n*   Finally, the user returns to the email client and composes and sends a message, \"Wut lowkey,\" in the conversation with 'karen vo' at 5:49 PM. The \"async notification fallback issues\" panel from the development environment is visible in the background, indicating the Mail application is now the active window.",

This dynamic movement between distinct types of tasks (coding, social communication, AI research) is a clear pattern of rapid context switching.

A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue.

The `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file is open in the main panel, alongside terminal output showing log messages related to \"gemini-2-5-flash\" and \"notifications.\" A floating \"Schedule\" dialog, which appears to be part of a productivity application like \"Focus Pro,\" is overlaid on the right side of the screen, with a 5:48 PM scheduled event highlighted.\n*   The user then switches from the code editor to a mail client (likely Apple Mail). They are viewing an ongoing email conversation with \"karen vo,\" discussing potential dates for a trip (e.g., \"leave 12/10 night or 12/11 morning\").\n*   Next, the user switches to a web browser (likely Safari), which is displaying a Claude AI chat interface. The selected chat is titled \"Swift notification system batch processing issue.\" The floating \"Schedule\" dialog reappears, overlaid on the browser window, still showing the 5:48 PM entry highlighted, indicating it's an application running in the background or a persistent window. This action occurs at 5:48:45 PM, almost concurrently with the initial view of the code editor.\n*   Finally, the user switches back to the mail client, continuing the conversation with \"karen vo\" where they discuss ski pass discounts and potential airline calls. The \"Schedule\" dialog is no longer visible on top of the mail client.\n\n**Specific actions by the user:**\n\n*   **Switching Applications:** The user transitions between a code editor, a mail client, and a web browser multiple times within the captured sequence.\n*   **Email Communication:** The user is actively participating in an email exchange, typing and receiving messages related to travel planning.\n*   **Viewing a Code Editor:** The user displays and potentially reviews code project files and terminal output in the first image.\n*   **Accessing an AI Chatbot:** The user opens a web browser to interact with the Claude AI chatbot at one point.\n*   **Interacting with a Scheduler (Implied):** The persistent \"Schedule\" dialog, highlighting 5:48 PM in both the first and fourth images, suggests the user might be using or monitoring a scheduling tool, possibly triggering an event at that time.",

This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

This dynamic movement between distinct types of tasks (coding, social communication, AI research) is a clear pattern of rapid context switching. The `customnudge` system's 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' log at 5:50 PM explicitly identifies this behavior, noting 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work',' and that a previous 'notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago).'",

A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

The left sidebar displays a project structure, including various Python files under a `customnudge` directory. In the terminal/output pane, system logs show `INFO` messages related to a \"Started adaptive nudge window\" and a \"notification task.\" The right pane presents instructions for \"Fixing async notification fallback issues,\" detailing queue management commands.\n*   **Image 2 & 3:** The user switches to a mail application, viewing an email conversation with \"karen vo.\" The messages discuss ski passes, dates, and \"ikon passes.\" In Image 3, the user is actively typing a reply, \"You used Estellas last yr?\"\n*   **Image 4:** The user transitions to a web-based AI assistant, \"Claude,\" which is open to a chat about a \"Swift notification system batch processing issue.\" A \"Focus Pro\" task scheduler pop-up is visible, showing a schedule with various time blocks, including one from 5:48 PM to 11:48 PM.\n*   **Image 5 & 6:** The user returns to the IDE. The left sidebar now displays a calendar view for November 2025. The terminal/output pane shows a `NOTIFICATION MESSAGE` from the `customnudge` system, prompting the user to \"Reviewing your schedule! Remember your goal: get coding project to work. Back to coding?\" Below this, an `LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION` details the system's analysis: it identifies \"Eyrun's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal,\" assesses the relevance, impact, importance, and urgency, and ultimately decides \"X No notification sent,\" implying the system chose not to deliver an interruption. The user appears to be reviewing these logs.\n\n**Specific actions the user is taking:**\n\n*   **Running commands in the terminal:** In Image 1, the output indicates commands like `pnpm install` and `npm run gum_cli --reset-cache` were executed.\n*   **Reading and composing emails:** The user is seen viewing an email conversation and typing a response in Images 2 and 3.\n*   **Interacting with an AI assistant and task scheduler:** In Image 4, the user has opened Claude AI and a \"Focus Pro\" scheduling tool, likely for project assistance or time management.\n*   **Reviewing system logs and notifications:** Across Images 1, 5, and 6, the user is observing the output and decision-making process of the `customnudge` notification system in the IDE's terminal pane.",

This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

A right sidebar in VS Code presents options for \"Fixing async notification fallback issues\" and shows that a \"batcher\" has started with 330 items.\n*   **Image 2 (5:47:48 PM):** The user *switches to the Apple Mail client*. An email conversation with \"karen vo\" is displayed, discussing ski pass options and potential travel dates (12/10 or 12/11 morning for 5/6 days). Other email threads are visible in the left pane.\n*   **Image 3 (5:48:15 PM):** The user is still in the Apple Mail client, observing further updates to the conversation with \"karen vo,\" which now includes messages like \"You used Estellas last yr?\" and \"its worth a shot,\" indicating continued email interaction.\n*   **Image 4 (5:48:45 PM):** The user *switches to a web browser* (likely Chrome) and is interacting with an AI chat interface named \"Claude.\" The chat is titled \"Swift notification system batch processing issue.\" A pop-up modal labeled \"Quick Start\" with a \"Schedule\" tab is visible, showing various time slots, with the \"5:48 PM - 11:48 PM\" slot highlighted.\n*   **Image 5 (5:50:13 PM):** The user *returns to Visual Studio Code*. The terminal output has updated, displaying new INFO messages about processing observations, finding propositions, and a \"DECISION: should_notify=True\" message. A calendar view for November 2025 is now visible in the left sidebar, along with \"Booking pages\" and \"My calendars.\"\n*   **Image 6 (5:50:24 PM):** While still in Visual Studio Code, the user *activates a search bar for \"settings\"*, which appears at the top of the left sidebar, overlapping the calendar view. The terminal output continues to update, now showing `ERROR` messages related to \"Open System Settings - Notifications & Focus\" and \"Allow Notifications,\" suggesting a system configuration issue that the user might be attempting to address via settings.\n\nHere are a handful of bullet points highlighting specific user actions:\n\n*   The user is *monitoring the progress of a Python project* in VS Code, as evidenced by the terminal output describing model processing and notification messages.\n*   The user *checks and responds to emails* in Apple Mail, engaging in a conversation about travel plans and expenses.\n*   The user *interacts with an AI assistant (Claude)* in a web browser, focusing on a \"Swift notification system batch processing issue\" and configuring a \"Quick Start\" schedule.\n*   The user *observes new error messages in VS Code's terminal* regarding system notifications, specifically issues with \"Open System Settings - Notifications & Focus\" and \"Allow Notifications.\"\n*   The user *initiates a search for \"settings\" within VS Code*, likely in response to the observed notification errors, to troubleshoot or adjust configurations.",

        "reasoning": "Within the approximately 4-minute observed window (from 01:48 to 01:52, based on the transcript's overarching timeframe, with internal timestamps like 5:48 PM to 5:52 PM), Eyrin rapidly transitions between the VS Code IDE (engaged with the `CUSTOMNUDGE` project and debugging notification issues), the Messages application (actively participating in an excited conversation with 'karen vo' about a ski trip), and the Chrome browser (consulting Claude AI for technical assistance). This dynamic movement between distinct types of tasks (coding, social communication, AI research) is a clear pattern of rapid context switching. The `customnudge` system's 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' log at 5:50 PM explicitly identifies this behavior, noting 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work',' and that a previous 'notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago).'",

The fact that it fails in `50ms` (17:50:00.733 -> 17:50:00.791) means it never even tries to show the notification - it falls the auth check.\n    *   ### Diagnostic Fix\n    *   First, let's see the actual error.\n    *   How can I help you today?

This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

        "reasoning": "Within a short observation period (less than 2 minutes total), Eyrin transitions swiftly between multiple applications and contexts. For example, Eyrin moves from `VS Code` (coding) to `Apple Mail` (personal email with 'karen vo') to `Claude AI` (technical problem-solving) and back to `VS Code` within the first minute. Subsequent observations show Eyrin cycling between `macOS System Settings` (checking notifications for 'loader.to'), `Claude AI` (detailed technical analysis), and `iMessage` (communicating with 'karen vo' and 'chuer & mary'). Eyrin's `iMessage` activity includes sending messages like 'I wonder if Varun would be down lol', 'WE LOVE U', 'WHAT ABOUT MOROCCO', and attaching images, often bringing `iMessage` to the foreground for quick bursts of communication while `Claude AI` remains open in the background.",

Further shifts involve interacting with the **Messages app** (iMessage conversations with 'karen vo', 'chuer & mary', and a new message to 'chuer yang') and a web browser displaying `cruose.ai/chat`.

user begins by actively working within a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, examining files like `setup_instructions.md` and a `q00000` entry within the `customnudge` project. They are monitoring a terminal output panel displaying extensive log messages (INFO level, timestamped around `2025-11-13 17:46:xx`) detailing processes involving `gemini-2.5-flash`, `training_data.json`, and notification systems. Concurrently, a sidebar in VS Code addresses \"Fixing async notification fallback issues,\" discussing queue status and offering commands to resolve these.\n\nThe user then switches to their Mail application, where they are reading and scrolling through an email conversation with \"karen vo.\" This discussion revolves around travel plans, the cost of ski passes, potential discounts, and specific dates (December 10th and 11th) for a trip. The conversation also includes casual remarks like \"lol ikr.\"\n\nSubsequently, the user interacts with the Claude AI assistant application. They are reviewing a chat thread titled \"Swift notification system batch processing issue.\" Initially, a pop-up window named \"Untitled\" is open, showing a schedule with highlighted time slots, suggesting the user is planning or reviewing a task schedule. Later, the user examines the main chat interface, which displays discussions and log entries related to \"blocking fallback\" mechanisms, `process_observation_batch` checks, `gRPC` operations, `TrainingDataLogger` initialization, and `LLM Decision` outcomes.\n\nFinally, the user returns to their VS Code environment. At this point, the Calendar application has been integrated into VS Code's left sidebar, displaying November 2025 with the 13th highlighted. The user continues to observe updated terminal logs (now timestamped around `2025-11-13 17:50:xx`), which include a \"NOTIFICATION MESSAGE\" reminding them to review their schedule and focus on their coding project, alongside further logs detailing `training_data`, `adaptive nudge`, and `LLM Decision` activities, with the \"Fixing async notification fallback issues\" panel remaining visible.\n\nHere's a summary of specific actions:\n\n*   **User navigates the VS Code IDE**, inspecting project files like `setup_instructions.md` and `q00000` while reviewing real-time terminal output concerning notification systems and `gemini-2.5-flash`.\n*   **User reads and scrolls through an email conversation** in the Mail app with \"karen vo,\" discussing travel logistics, ski pass costs, and potential discounts.\n*   **User interacts with the Claude AI assistant**, initially examining a scheduling pop-up within a chat about a \"Swift notification system batch processing issue,\" and subsequently reviewing detailed logs and discussions regarding `blocking fallback` and `LLM Decision` processes.\n*   **User integrates their Calendar into the VS Code environment** (displaying November 2025 with the 13th highlighted) while continuing to observe updated project logs and a panel dedicated to resolving asynchronous notification issues.",

The Messages app remains open in the background, showing the \"chuer & mary\" chat title.\n\n*   **Image 5 (00:00:08 - 00:00:10):** The user switches back to the Messages app and the \"karen vo\" conversation.\n    *   The Messages app is brought to the foreground, obscuring part of the Claude window.\n    *   The user views recent messages, including a threaded reply \"WHAT ABOUT MOROCCO,\" and then types and sends the message \"Bro is actually asking for a slap to the face.\"\n\n*   **Image 6-7 (00:00:10 - 00:00:14):** The user completely changes their desktop environment, transitioning to a code development environment.\n    *   The screen switches to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), likely Visual Studio Code or similar, displaying a file browser, code editor, and a terminal output pane.\n    *   The Claude AI interface is still open on the left, but the primary focus is now on the IDE, which shows files like `test_async_notifications_standalone.py` and `notifier_swift_mac_notifier.swift`.\n    *   On the right of the IDE, a panel titled \"Fixing async notification fails\" outlines a plan.\n    *   In Image 7, the terminal output in the IDE updates, displaying new log messages and a clear indication \"Should Notify?: X NO,\" suggesting that a process has been run or evaluated within the IDE.\n\nIn summary, the user transitions between personal messaging, reviewing a technical document in Claude AI, and actively working in a code development environment, while keeping multiple applications open and switching their focus as needed.",

For example, Eyrin moves from `VS Code` (coding) to `Apple Mail` (personal email with 'karen vo') to `Claude AI` (technical problem-solving) and back to `VS Code` within the first minute. Subsequent observations show Eyrin cycling between `macOS System Settings` (checking notifications for 'loader.to'), `Claude AI` (detailed technical analysis), and `iMessage` (communicating with 'karen vo' and 'chuer & mary'). Eyrin's `iMessage` activity includes sending messages like 'I wonder if Varun would be down lol', 'WE LOVE U', 'WHAT ABOUT MOROCCO', and attaching images, often bringing `iMessage` to the foreground for quick bursts of communication while `Claude AI` remains open in the background.",
