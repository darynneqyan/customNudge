They are viewing Python code (specifically `_capture.py`) and observing real-time output in the integrated terminal, which shows information related to `implementation_summary.md` and \"Running Gemini-2.5-flash\". Concurrently, the user is monitoring system processes and potential errors through a dedicated \"Run code and check for errors\" panel, which provides details on terminating processes using `pkill` commands.\n*   **Simultaneous Communication:** In the second image, the user is engaged in a messaging application, likely Microsoft Teams, where they are actively chatting with a contact named \"darrynne\".\n*   **Updating Debugging Status:** The user explicitly sends a message to \"darrynne\" stating, \"I am deep in the debugging\", directly indicating their current task and linking the debugging activity from the first image to their communication.\n*   **Collaborative Design Discussion:** The conversation with \"darrynne\" includes mentions of \"design decisions,\" \"GOAL SETTING,\" and specific decision points related to \"generate propositions,\" suggesting a collaborative development environment where the user is debugging code that is part of a larger project involving shared design choices.\n*   **Task Coordination:** The user also sends a message to \"darrynne\" asking them to \"try checking in for me when u leave,\" indicating coordination of tasks or responsibilities.",

The influence of 'getting distracted by notifications' during the '2 hours' of procrastination is also explicitly stated.",

The sequence 'User opened VS Code and started coding Python', 'User switched to browser and opened YouTube', and 'User returned to VS Code and continued coding' occurring within an 'extremely compressed timeframe of approximately 0.000592 seconds' provides explicit evidence of very brief, possibly unintentional, shifts to other applications from which Eyrin swiftly re-engages with the primary task, distinct from prolonged distraction.",

The user is actively reviewing problem outputs and terminal logs, which show \"INFO Processing batch of 5 observations\" messages, suggesting that batch operations are running or being debugged.\n\n2.  **Addressing System Processes:** In a dedicated panel titled \"Run code and check for errors\" within VS Code, the user is presented with suggestions for terminating processes related to `gum.cli` using `pkill` and `ps aux | grep` commands. This indicates a need to manage or restart parts of the running system.\n\n3.  **Monitoring and Debugging Batch Processing:** The user interacts with a sidebar in VS Code titled \"Add batch processing monitoring,\" which lists \"decision steps\" and options to \"Create debug logger\" and \"Add debug logging to gum.py for batch processing steps.\" This suggests a focus on understanding and tracing the flow of data and decisions within their batch processing system.\n\n4.  **Receiving Behavioral Nudges:** Throughout their work in VS Code, the user is receiving \"GUM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\" via a \"Problems\" panel and a separate \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" application window. These nudges are context-aware, for example, suggesting to return to \"customNudg batcher logic\" if the user switches to a \"generic Google search\" or advising against distraction when in a \"highly focused work state.\"\n\n5.  **Communicating via Messaging Application:** The user is actively using a messaging application (resembling Google Chat) to communicate with multiple contacts. Conversations include personal updates (\"Awesome lemme finish debugging and then look over...\") and social interactions (\"Fun Car?!?\", \"rage cage?\").\n\n6.  **Web Browsing and AI Development:** The user has multiple browser tabs open, including a standard Google search page and \"Google AI Studio\" (visible in multiple images). This suggests a combination of research and interaction with AI development tools or APIs.\n\nHere are the bullet points referencing specific user actions:\n\n*   The user is **editing and debugging Python code** in `state_capture.py` within VS Code, focusing on `async` functions and `self.batcher.start()` calls for batch processing (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **reviews terminal output and problem reports** in VS Code, specifically observing \"INFO Processing batch of 5 observations\" and \"GUM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" messages (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **engages with debugging tools and suggestions** in VS Code, including a panel for \"Run code and check for errors\" that offers `pkill` commands for `gum.cli` processes, and a sidebar for \"Add batch processing monitoring\" (Image 1, 2, 6, 7).\n*   The user **responds to and views behavioral nudges** from the \"GUM Notifications - Eyrin\" system, which provides context-aware advice related to task focus and transitions (Image 2, 7, 8).\n*   The user **communicates via a messaging application**, sending and receiving messages related to both work (\"lemme finish debugging\") and personal topics (\"Fun Car?!?\") (Image 3, 5).\n*   The user has **multiple web browser tabs open**, including a Google search page and Google AI Studio, indicating concurrent browsing and interaction with AI-related services (Image 3, 4, 5, 8).",

Explicit evidence for brief, self-corrected shifts is noted, such as a switch to `YouTube` for 'approximately 0.000592 seconds' before returning to `VS Code` (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4). Crucially, the `GUM Notifications - Eyrin` application explicitly flags this behavior: a 'SENT - PRODUCTIVITY' nudge states 'Eyrin transitioned from focused Python development on 'customNudgJ' batch processing to a generic Gocogle search' (Screenshot 2, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), indicating a recognized pattern.

Eyrin's multi-application environment is consistently observed, with rapid switches between `Visual Studio Code` (for coding/debugging), the `Messages` application (communicating with `Darynne` and `mom`), and `Google Chrome` (for `AI consultation`, `Google Search` for 'mess', `YouTube`) within compressed timeframes (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4 & 6th set of observations). Explicit evidence for brief, self-corrected shifts is noted, such as a switch to `YouTube` for 'approximately 0.000592 seconds' before returning to `VS Code` (Screenshot 9, Input Prop 4). Crucially, the `GUM Notifications - Eyrin` application explicitly flags this behavior: a 'SENT - PRODUCTIVITY' nudge states 'Eyrin transitioned from focused Python development on 'customNudgJ' batch processing to a generic Gocogle search' (Screenshot 2, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), indicating a recognized pattern. Conversely, `X NOT SENT` notifications are recorded when Eyrin is in a 'highly focused work state' within `VS Code` (Screenshot 1, Input Prop 2 & 2nd set of observations), confirming the system's role in managing these transitions.",

Several other Python and YAML files are open as tabs, including `ilm_judge.py` and `deploy-docs.yml`. The left sidebar shows a project explorer labeled \"CUSTOMNUDGE\" with various directories and files. The bottom panel's \"OUTPUT\" tab is active, displaying numerous `INFO` messages related to a \"notifications-model 'gemini-2.5-flash'\", suggesting the user is monitoring a running process or reviewing build/runtime logs. The code window for `notifier.py` shows highlighted lines (515-519) within a `print` statement, indicating a potential point of interest or recent modification.\n\n*   **Transition to a New Project/Debugging (Image 2):** The user has switched context, likely opening a new workspace or project. The previous open tabs are replaced with files related to a project named \"hw6_bayesian\", with `submission.py` currently active and in focus. The left sidebar now displays the `hw6_bayesian` project structure. The bottom panel's \"TERMINAL\" tab is active, showing a traceback indicating an error. Specifically, an `Exception: browm <cli:Exception> -- Not implemented yet` occurred, pointing to line 435 in `submission.py`, likely within an `em_learn` function, and referencing `grader.py`. This suggests the user is in the process of developing or debugging an assignment or task, and a test run has failed because a required part of their code is not yet implemented.\n\n**Specific actions the user is taking:**\n\n*   **Monitoring System Output:** In the first image, the user is reviewing the \"OUTPUT\" panel, which displays system information and logs, possibly from a running application or a build process involving a \"gemini-2.5-flash\" model.\n*   **Navigating Code:** The user has `notifier.py` open and focused in the first image, and then `submission.py` in the second, indicating they are navigating between different code files relevant to their current tasks.\n*   **Debugging/Testing Code:** In the second image, the user is observing the \"TERMINAL\" output, which shows a failed test run due to a \"Not implemented yet\" exception in their `submission.py` file, indicating they are in the process of developing and testing a solution.",

(page 2)\nWhat is the shape of the counts table for such a node? It will be `tuple(parent_domains_lengths) + (current_node_domain_length)`.\n\n**Browser Content (Main Body):**\nBayesian network for annotator labels\n1. Check if the node is observed. Is `node_name` in the `assignment_id` dictionary? If not, you can't accumulate counts for it (it's unobserved).\n2. Get the node's value: What value does this node take in this assignment? How do you convert that value to an index in the node's domain?\n3. Handle parents:\n    *   If the node has no parents, where in `counts[node_name]` should you add the weight? (Hint: remember the batch dimension and the `idx` variable)\n    *   If the node has parents, you need to figure out which parent configuration this is. Look at the helper method `node_parent_assignment_indices(assignment_i)` \u2013 what does it return?\n4. Update the counts: Add `weight` to the appropriate location in `counts[node_name]`.\n    *   Key questions to ask yourself:\n        *   For a root node (no parents), what's the shape of its counts table?\n        *   For a node with parents, what indices do you need to properly index into the counts table?\n        *   Where does `idx` (the batch index) fit into this indexing?\n    *   `mle_estimation` hints:\n        *   Think about the MLE process.\n        *   1.

The code block for `accumulate_assignment` is visible, along with comments indicating \"BEGIN_CODE\" and \"END_CODE\" where user implementation is expected.\n*   **Observing and Responding to Errors (Image 3, 4):** The terminal output in VS Code (Image 3 and 4) clearly shows a `NotImplementedError` originating from `submission.py`, specifically at line 435 within an `em_learn` function and line 694. This indicates that a required part of the code has not yet been implemented or has been explicitly marked as not implemented.\n*   **Consulting AI for Instructions and Hints (Image 2, 5):** The user switches to a web browser to consult a Claude AI chat interface.\n    *   In **Image 2**, the user is reading high-level instructions for a \"Bayesian network for annotator labels\" assignment, covering steps 1-4 for updating counts.\n    *   In **Image 5**, the user has expanded the \"mle_estimation hints\" section within the Claude AI chat, which provides more specific guidance for implementation, including \"Initialize counts\", \"Add smoothing\", and \"Accumulate data\". This suggests the user is looking for guidance to resolve the `NotImplementedError` encountered in their code.\n\nIn essence, the user is iterating between coding in VS Code, encountering an error (due to unimplemented code), and then seeking guidance from a Claude AI chat to understand how to implement the missing functionality and resolve the error.",

Sonnet 4.5,' suggesting Eyrin is consulting an `AI model (like Claude)` for explanations or code related to the `batcher`'s `start()` method. The earlier terminal output confirming the use of `gemini-2.5-flash` further strengthens the pattern of integrating AI into the development process.",

Additionally, a tab in **VS Code** (23:14:11, 23:15:12) is named `bfrf1954 - implement notif cool. (1 file) x`, which is a common naming convention for feature branches in Git. Furthermore, a Chrome tab (23:15:12) contains the text 'commit my branch to main', suggesting Eyrin is either reviewing or preparing for a code commit operation.
