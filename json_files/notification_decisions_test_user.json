    "reasoning": "User is actively procrastinating on an important project deadline by watching YouTube cat videos. This behavior (watching YouTube instead of working on deadlines) is a recurring, highly relevant pattern for test_user, suggesting it's likely a sustained distraction rather than a brief, unintentional shift. While a social media nudge was sent recently, this is a different platform. A timely, actionable notification can help interrupt the procrastination cycle and redirect test_user's focus. There's no specific effectiveness data, but addressing a known problematic pattern is valuable.",

However, two productivity notifications were sent only seconds ago (at 21:08:11 and 21:08:27) addressing very similar distraction patterns (social media, YouTube). Sending another notification immediately would likely lead to notification fatigue, reduce overall impact, and could contribute to the user being 'distracted by notifications' as mentioned in the current observation. It's better to allow some time for the previous nudges to take effect or for the user's context to change.",
