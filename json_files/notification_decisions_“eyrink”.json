This indicates active engagement with general browsing and email.\n2.  **Presence of a Python application:** Some observations mention \"macOS Top Bar: python File Edit View Window Help\" or \"Application: python Menu Bar Items: Python, File, Edit, Window, Help\". This suggests a Python application is open or was recently active.\n\nWhile the presence of a \"python\" application could *potentially* indicate an environment for coding, the overwhelming evidence points to the user actively engaging with non-coding activities in Chrome (email, general browsing). The nudge specifically asked the user to *focus* on finishing coding projects. Simply having a Python application open in the background, or having it appear briefly in the menu bar while the user is actively browsing non-coding tabs, does not demonstrate a shift in *focus* towards coding projects. There is no evidence of the user interacting with coding files, an IDE, or coding-related documentation.\n\nTherefore, the observations largely confirm the automated system's classification of non-compliance. There is insufficient evidence to suggest an *attempt* to comply with the nudge by shifting focus to coding, as the active engagement appears to be with unrelated tasks.",

This is strong evidence of non-compliance with the first part of the nudge.\n2.  **\"Focus on finishing your coding project!\"**:\n    *   The predominant application in the observations is Google Chrome, with tabs like \"Mail\" and \"Goog!\" (Google search).

While this *could* indicate a coding environment, it's not the primary application shown in most transcriptions, which emphasize Chrome. Without more direct evidence of active coding within a Python environment (e.g., code editor visible, project files open, compiler output), this single line in a menu bar is insufficient to suggest compliance, especially when contrasted with the other observations.\n\nThe presence of \"Coffee Chat\" content and the user being primarily engaged in browser activities unrelated to coding strongly confirms the non-compliant state reported by the system.

Sending a 4th one now would likely contribute to notification fatigue, especially given the 'ideal frequency is no more than once every 5 minutes' guideline.\n2.  **Similarity to Recent Notification:** A notification was sent at 14:51:09 about 'How will Granola apply to your CS221 assignment?', which is very similar in topic to the proposed notification. The guideline states 'DON'T notify when: Recent (~ past 3) notifications already addressed this, and previous notifications are in the same category.'\n3.  **Low Effectiveness Rate:** The overall effectiveness rate is very low (9.1%), suggesting that more notifications, particularly similar ones during active work, are unlikely to be effective and could lead to annoyance. The learning insight suggests 'need for different approach or timing.' Currently, eyrink is actively working, albeit potentially on two tasks.

While messaging is open, the conversation is directly related to verifying the project's functionality (e.g., 'How can I verify that the nudge?'). This is goal-aligned collaboration, not a distraction. A highly relevant notification ('ICL fix ready! Run the GUI to test it & progress on your homework project.') was sent recently. Sending another notification now would be redundant and disruptive, as eyrink is actively working on the task and exhibiting goal-aligned behavior. Learning from previous actions, 'Messages open!' nudges were effective when a distraction, but this is a different context. Guidelines suggest not notifying when a user is actively working on a task.",
