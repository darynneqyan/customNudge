This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue.

Crucially, the terminal output from Eyrin's `customnudge` project logs an 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' at '2023-11-13 17:50:00,718'. This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

Crucially, the terminal output from Eyrin's `customnudge` project logs an 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' at '2023-11-13 17:50:00,718'. This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

Initially, they are on a specific Lightscape event page (`ggggp.org/lightscape?pid...`) for the Gardens of Golden Gate Park, which highlights sponsors for Lightscape 2025. Following this, the user navigates to the main Lightscape page (`ggggp.org/lightscape`) to view ticket information, including prices for adults, youth, and children. They scroll down this page to view more details, including a list of partners and sponsors.\n\nNext, the user performs a Google search for \"sf exploratorium\". The search results page displays various links and a knowledge panel providing details about the Exploratorium, such as its address, history, contact information, and admission prices from different vendors like the official site, Trip.com, and Groupon.\n\nFinally, the user shifts back to a development context. They open or bring to the foreground a GitHub page for a repository, likely named `customNUDGE`, displaying its \"About\" section and commit history. Concurrently, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), possibly VS Code, is active, showing the `customNUDGE` project. Within the IDE, the user is viewing a markdown file (`training_guide.md`) containing a \"Testing Guide\" and \"Quick Test Command\" for the project. The console/terminal within the IDE shows logs related to \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" and \"processing notifications,\" specifically \"searching for propositions similar to: Eyirin is actively engaged in software dev ecosystem,\" echoing the \"Focus Nudge\" reminder from earlier.\n\n**Specific User Actions:**\n\n*   **Navigating a Website:** The user opened a Chrome browser and browsed pages related to \"Lightscape\" at `ggggp.org`, viewing event details, ticket prices, and sponsors.\n*   **Performing a Search Query:** The user executed a Google search for \"sf exploratorium\" in the Chrome browser to gather information about the Exploratorium.\n*   **Switching Contexts to Development:** The user brought a GitHub repository page into view, presumably to review or work on the `customNUDGE` project.\n*   **Interacting with an IDE:** The user opened an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as VS Code, to view project documentation (`training_guide.md`) and monitor system output/logs for the `customNUDGE` project.",

This window displays the Golden Gate Park Conservancy website (`gggp.org`), specifically a page promoting the \"Lightscape\" event and listing its sponsors for 2025, such as Sony Music, PG&E, ZOOX, and KQED. The page also includes an option to \"Become a Sponsor.\" A banner across the top states \"LIGHTSCAPE TICKETS ARE GOING QUICK! GET TICKETS NOW.\" The system clock shows 2:26:50 PM.\n\nIn the next browser view (Image 3), still on `gggp.org/lightscape/`, the content shifts to explicitly show the \"Tickets\" section for Lightscape, detailing prices for Adult, Youth, Child, and Flex Tickets. The main visual features people walking through an illuminated tunnel. Notably, the system clock in this image displays 2:26:16 PM, which is earlier than the timestamp in Image 2, suggesting a non-chronological capture of browser states relative to the system clock.\n\nFollowing this, the user opens a new tab or navigates to a Google search page (Image 4) and searches for \"sf exploratorium.\" The search results provide comprehensive information about the Exploratorium, including its address, founding year, director, visitor numbers, public transit details, phone number, and operating hours. Admission prices from various sources like the official site, Trip.com, and Groupon are also displayed. The system clock shows 2:27:03 PM.\n\nFinally, the user returns to the desktop environment (Image 5 & 6). A GitHub repository page for a project named \"customNudge\" is visible, showing basic project information like the number of commits and that it's 100% Python. A \"Focus Nudge\" notification appears in the top right, prompting the user to \"finish coding projects.\" Concurrently, the \"customNudge Decisions\" application is brought into focus, revealing a Visual Studio Code interface (Image 6). Within the IDE, several Python files (`training_logger.py`, `gum.py`, `batcher.py`, `notifier.py`) and a Markdown file (`training_guide.md`) are open, all related to the \"customNudge\" project. The `training_guide.md` details instructions for \"Running GUM with In-Context Learning\" and \"Quick Test Command.\" A terminal or log pane at the bottom displays \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" information, showing timestamps from \"2025-11-29 14:27:25\" with details about notification types and decisions. The system clock remains at 2:27:51 PM.\n\n**Specific actions the user is taking:**\n\n*   **Browsing for event information:** The user navigates a web browser (Chrome) to view details, including sponsor information and ticket prices, for the \"Lightscape\" event at the Golden Gate Park.\n*   **Conducting an informational search:** The user performs a Google search for \"sf exploratorium\" to gather details such as location, operating hours, and various admission costs for the Exploratorium.\n*   **Reviewing a code repository:** The user is viewing a GitHub page for a \"customNudge\" project, indicating an interest in or oversight of the project's codebase.\n*   **Engaging in software development:** The user is actively working within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), reviewing a `training_guide.md` file and examining a \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" log related to the \"customNudge\" project.\n*   **Receiving productivity nudges:** A \"Focus Nudge\" notification suggests the user is interacting with a system designed to encourage task completion, specifically for coding projects.",

A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

The guidelines state that notifications should not be sent when the user is actively working... Sending a nudge now would be counterproductive and helpful.'

This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.'

The session begins with the user investigating why a notification generated by an LLM (Large Language Model) is not appearing in a GUI.\n\n**Key actions and observations:**\n\n*   **Investigates LLM Notification Failure:** The user *views* the `notification_gui.py` file (Image 1), while the `customNudge` panel (right) explains that a path mismatch is preventing LLM notifications from being displayed on the GUI, suggesting a check of the project root path. The terminal concurrently displays an LLM notification decision, indicating a \"YES\" to notify for a \"goal-oriented workflow\" but with a \"pre-emptive cooldown.\"\n*   **Examines LLM Decision Logic:** The user *opens* the `notification_decisions_eyrin.json` file (Image 2) in the editor, a file that appears to define effectiveness scores and corresponding emojis for LLM feedback. At this point, the `customNudge` assistant's focus shifts, asking \"What does mean\" and diagnosing a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `sklearn` Python library, offering installation instructions.\n*   **Addresses Python Environment Issues:** The user *receives guidance* from `customNudge` regarding the missing `sklearn` library (Image 2) and subsequently *observes* the successful verification of their Python 3 environment (Image 3), including version and path details, implying they have followed the troubleshooting steps.\n*   **Monitors LLM Activity:** The user *reads* the terminal output, which evolves from showing specific LLM notification decisions (Image 1) to a more general prompt (\"Good to connect! What's the next step on your coding project?\") and detailed `INFO` logs about the LLM actively searching for propositions and processing observations (Images 2 and 3).\n*   **Persistent Errors:** Throughout all images, the \"Problems\" panel consistently displays `grPC` related errors, suggesting an underlying, unresolved system communication or setup issue separate from the immediate LLM interactions.",

An \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel provides dynamic suggestions and troubleshooting.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the actions:\n\n*   **Images 1-3: Initial State & System Analysis**\n    *   The user is viewing `notification_gui.py` in the main editor panel. The code shows a Python class `NotificationGUI`.\n    *   The terminal displays repeated `orkl()` errors, possibly indicating a system-level issue or a failed dependency initialization related to `fork_posix.cc`.\n    *   The \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel on the right is analyzing the situation, identifying `notification_gui.py` and suggesting potential issues with the project root or file parsing (e.g., \"Read notification_gui.py L1-66\").\n\n*   **Image 4: File Opened & New Error Identified**\n    *   **The user opens `notification_decisions_eyrink.json`** in a new tab within the editor, making it the active file. This JSON contains configuration data like `effectiveness_score` and `eff_emoji`.\n    *   The terminal output has changed. The `orkl()` errors are gone, replaced by `INFO` messages indicating the system is processing \"propositions\" and \"observations.\" It also shows \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" with `Should Notify: YES`.\n    *   The \"Evaluate system...\" panel has updated its content dramatically. It now reports an \"LLM ModelNotFound Error\" (specifically mentioning `_tkinter`) and suggests installing `tk` via `pip` or Homebrew, indicating a missing GUI dependency.\n\n*   **Images 5-6: GUI Execution & System Response**\n    *   **The user executes a Python command:** In the terminal, the prompt `(base) eyrink@MacBook-Pro-118 customNudge % python notification_gui.py eyrink` is visible. This action likely follows the suggestions from the \"Evaluate system...\" panel to address the `_tkinter` issue.\n    *   The terminal shows that the \"GUI window opening...\" has started, and it's \"Watching: notification_contexts_eyrink.json\". It also gives instructions to \"Make sure GUM is running with --enable-notifications\".\n    *   The \"Evaluate system...\" panel has updated again, now titled \"Use system Python.\" It explains that the \"System Python (/usr/bin/python3) has tkinter\" and suggests using it to run the GUI, with a \"Quick fix\" to update the shebang line or run the command explicitly.\n    *   The terminal continues to output details about the GUI project paths, confirming that `notification_decisions_eyrink.json` and `notification_contexts_eyrink.json` are being used, and reports `Decisions count: 13`.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The user starts by reviewing `notification_gui.py` while the system analyzes potential issues.\n*   The user *opens `notification_decisions_eyrink.json`*, which triggers further system analysis, revealing a missing `tkinter` dependency for the GUI.\n*   The user then *executes a python command (`python notification_gui.py eyrink`)* to run the GUI, successfully leveraging the system's `tkinter` installation as suggested by the integrated evaluation tool.",

Simultaneously, a web browser or integrated view shows the GitHub repository for \"customNudge,\" with information about the project. A \"Focus Nudge\" notification is visible in the top bar, reminding the user to \"finish coding projects!\" and about \"Coffee chat prep.\"\n*   **Image 2 (2:28:02 PM):** The user transitions to a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment. Files related to the `customNudge` project, specifically `training_logger.py`, `testing_guide.md`, and `notifier.py`, are open. In the integrated terminal, the user has executed a `gum` command to enable notifications with a `gemini-2.5-flash` model, followed by running `python notifier_gui.py TestUser`. On the right, an \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" interface asks \"Why is nothing showing up on the notification GUI?\", suggesting a debugging or evaluation task is underway.\n*   **Image 3 & 4 (2:29:02 PM):** The user appears to briefly interact with or view a \"Gemini 3 Pro Preview\" interface, possibly for configuring the LLM. This interface displays \"System instructions\" describing the model as a \"rational, first-principles problem solver.\" The \"customNudge Decisions\" application remains open and idle in the background.\n*   **Image 5 (2:29:02 PM):** The user returns to VS Code, with `notification_gui.py` now the active file. The terminal output explicitly states \"GUI window opening...\" and then displays an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION,\" including scores for relevance, urgency, and impact, along with a detailed explanation generated by the LLM. Crucially, the \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" interface on the right has diagnosed a \"Path mismatch\" as the reason why the notification might not be showing up on the intended GUI, indicating a conflict between relative paths used by the GUI and the notifier.\n*   **Image 6:** Continuing from Image 5, the terminal in VS Code fully displays the \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" and the final \"NOTIFICATION MESSAGE: Coffee chat questions can wait. Focus on finishing your coding project!\". This confirms the LLM successfully generated a notification. The evaluation interface on the right is still open, showing an attempt to fix the \"path mismatch\" issue to allow the notification to be displayed correctly by the GUI.\n\n**Specific user actions:**\n\n*   **Viewing project context:** The user *views* the `customNudge` GitHub repository (Image 1) and project files in VS Code (Images 2, 5, 6).\n*   **Running commands:** The user *executes* a `gum` command and `python notifier_gui.py TestUser` in the VS Code terminal (Images 2, 5).\n*   **Debugging/Evaluating:** The user *interacts with* an \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" interface, reviewing diagnostics for why the GUI isn't displaying notifications (Images 2, 5, 6).\n*   **Monitoring output:** The user *observes* the terminal output in VS Code, including the successful \"GUI window opening...\" and the full \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" and \"NOTIFICATION MESSAGE\" generated by the system (Images 5, 6).",

A 'NOTIFICATION MESSAGE' appears, stating 'Reviewing your schedule! Remember your goal: get coding project to work. Back to coding!', directly reflecting a productivity prompt. Another log explicitly states `Should Notify: \u2716 NO` with the reasoning that `Eyrin is currently deeply engaged in debugging their coding project... which goes against the guideline to \"not send notifications related to that task\"`. This demonstrates the system's ability to assess Eyrin's focus and adapt its notification behavior, aligning with the goal of self-regulation or productivity enhancement.

The internal 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' provides explicit rationale for these nudges, stating, for example, 'Eyrin is currently actively engaged in software development... which directly aligns with their goal of 'finish coding projects'. The guidelines state that notifications should not be sent when the user is actively working... Sending a nudge now would be counterproductive and helpful.' Conversely, it also notes when 'continued use of Claude for networking/coffee chat prep... is a potential distraction from the project.' This indicates a direct interaction with a system designed to regulate and guide eyrink's work focus.",

This behavior often leads to system-prompted re-focusing efforts, as evidenced by notifications from `customNudge` and `Focus Nudge`. Applications frequently switched between include `Visual Studio Code`, `Messages`/`iMessage`, `Apple Mail`, `Google Chrome Browser` (for `Claude AI` and other browsing), and `System Settings`.",
        "reasoning": "Numerous observations show rapid transitions between `Visual Studio Code` (coding), `Messages` (social), `Apple Mail` (personal travel plans with `karen vo`), and `Google Chrome Browser` (for `Claude AI` and other browsing/event planning). The `customNudge` system's `LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION` log explicitly identifies `Mail app` as a distraction, and a `Focus Nudge` notification states 'Noticing networking tasks. Your goal is to finish coding projects!'. The sheer number of open `Chrome` tabs also supports this.",

        "reasoning": "A 'Quick Start' overlay, offering 'Start Blocking' and 'Schedule' options with specific time slots (e.g., '5:48 PM 11:48 PM'), appears consistently across screenshots over both the Claude AI interface and the IDE, suggesting a dedicated focus management tool. Crucially, the terminal output from Eyrin's `customnudge` project logs an 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' at '2023-11-13 17:50:00,718'. This log explicitly includes the system's reasoning: 'Eyrin's current activity in the Mail app is a distraction from the stated goal 'get coding project to work'. A previous notification nudging Eyrin to return to coding was sent just (2-3 minutes ago). Sending another notification so soon would violate the ideal frequency guideline (no more than once every 5 minutes), risking notification fatigue. It's best to allow more time before a follow-up. \u274c No notification sent.' This directly confirms Eyrin is running (and likely developing/testing) a system designed to track activity, assess its relevance to a 'stated goal' ('get coding project to work'), and manage notifications to maintain focus.",

A 'NOTIFICATION MESSAGE' appears, stating 'Reviewing your schedule! Remember your goal: get coding project to work. Back to coding!', directly reflecting a productivity prompt. Another log explicitly states `Should Notify: \u2716 NO` with the reasoning that `Eyrin is currently deeply engaged in debugging their coding project... which goes against the guideline to \"not send notifications related to that task\"`. This demonstrates the system's ability to assess Eyrin's focus and adapt its notification behavior, aligning with the goal of self-regulation or productivity enhancement.

An integrated AI assistant is providing diagnostic information and solutions in the right-hand panel.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the actions and observations:\n\n*   **User observes GUI failure and seeks diagnosis (Image 1):** The user is viewing the Python source code for `notification_gui.py`. The AI assistant, in the \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel, has diagnosed why \"nothing is showing up on the notification GUI.\" It identifies an issue with how filenames containing quotes (e.g., `'eyrink'`) are handled, causing `notification_decisions_eyrink.json` to be expected but not found as `notification_d ecisions_eyrink.json`. The terminal output shows various `INFO` messages related to \"searching for propositions\" and system state.\n\n*   **User continues debugging as a new error emerges (Image 2):** The AI assistant updates its diagnosis to address a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'`, indicating that the Python environment being used lacks the `tkinter` module required for the GUI. The AI confirms the current Python path and version (Python 3.9.13). Simultaneously, the user's project is generating an LLM-based personalized notification for \"eyrink\" (likely the user), encouraging them to return to \"coding projects\" and providing a sample message in the terminal.\n\n*   **User receives a system-level solution for the GUI (Image 3):** The AI assistant proposes a \"System Solution: Use system Python\" (`/usr/bin/python3`) because it includes `tkinter`, unlike the Homebrew Python currently in use. It offers a \"Quick fix\" to update the script's shebang or use a helper script. The AI also outlines steps the GUI needs to take to correctly display data, such as using absolute paths and handling quoted filenames. The terminal shows the GUI attempting to start, successfully identifying context and decision files, suggesting that the initial file-path issue might be internally addressed or being tested.\n\n*   **User receives a comprehensive summary and explicit next steps (Image 4):** The AI assistant provides a concise summary of the problem (Homebrew Python lacks tkinter) and the fix (use system Python). It then explicitly instructs the user to *run a specific command*: `/usr/bin/python3 notification_gui_eyrink.py` to launch the GUI correctly, expecting that the GUI will now update to use correct paths and handle quoted filenames. The terminal continues to show various warnings and `INFO` messages related to the project's operation.",

The code snippet visible describes logic for calculating an \"effectiveness score\" and displaying corresponding emojis.\n*   In the integrated terminal within VS Code, the user is observing the output of a recently executed Python script (Images 1-5). The output includes \"LSM NOTIFICATION DECISION,\" reasoning for a notification, and multiple `INFO` log entries related to \"notification task\" and \"observation window robustness.\"\n*   The terminal output also prominently displays several `W000...gRPC` warning messages (visible in Images 1, 5, and later pasted into the AI chat), indicating an issue or an aspect of gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) running during the script's execution.\n*   A \"Focus Nudge\" pop-up is active in VS Code (Images 1-5), providing guidance on evaluating Python scripts within a VS Code Dev Container, specifically mentioning Python 3.13 (Homebrew) and tkinter.\n*   The user then opens Google Chrome (Images 6-9), navigates to the Claude.ai chat interface (Image 10).\n*   The user *pastes* the `W000...gRPC` warning messages from their VS Code terminal directly into the Claude.ai chat (Image 10).\n*   The user *types and submits a query* to Claude.ai, asking, \"what does mean when the code is running? is this ok?\" (Image 10).\n*   After a brief processing period (Images 11-13), the AI assistant (Claude.ai) *generates and displays a detailed response* (Image 14). This response explains that the gRPC messages are warnings related to how gRPC handles subprocesses in a forked environment, suggesting solutions such as suppressing the warnings via environment variables (`GRPC_VERBOSITY`, `GRPC_TRACE`) or using an asynchronous subprocess.",

The internal 'LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION' provides explicit rationale for these nudges, stating, for example, 'Eyrin is currently actively engaged in software development... which directly aligns with their goal of 'finish coding projects'. The guidelines state that notifications should not be sent when the user is actively working... Sending a nudge now would be counterproductive and helpful.'

It also includes a section on \"Biden Administration Experience,\" describing roles and experiences. The presence of a \"Write follow up email\" button and \"eirin.kimm@gmail.com\" in the sidebar suggests the user is either drafting a professional communication or organizing thoughts related to their career.\n*   **Checking Emails (Image 2, 2:44:40 PM):** The user then switches to Outlook, where they are viewing the inbox for \"eyrinkim@stanford.edu.\" The active email is a \"TechCrunch Week in Review\" from November 29, 2025. The email highlights several tech and finance news stories, including a data breach impacting US banks, a report on autonomous weapons, and commentary on stock market figures. This indicates the user is catching up on industry news or professional correspondence.\n*   **Browsing a GitHub Repository (Images 3-8, 2:45:31 PM - 2:46:10 PM):** The user proceeds to GitHub, specifically viewing the `kevinzhu/betterZestimate` public repository. The main page displays the repository's file structure, including `data`, `src`, and various files related to `re_portfolio_ppo` and `real_estate_ddpg`. The sidebar notes \"Python 100.0%\" as the language. These repeated images suggest a continuous period of browsing or examining the repository's contents.\n*   **Engaging with an Integrated Development Environment (Image 9, 2:47:11 PM):** Finally, the user is in a VS Code-like integrated development environment (IDE). Multiple Python files related to a `customNudge` project are open, including `cli.py`, `lm_judge.py`, and `__init__.py`. The console output pane displays `INFO` messages from a running process, indicating active code execution or debugging. A sidebar shows sections for \"Evaluate system for in-context learning,\" \"Changes made,\" and \"Testing,\" possibly part of a code review or development workflow. A chat window labeled \"darynne\" with the text \"How can I\" is partially visible, suggesting potential collaboration or seeking assistance.",

The `TESTING_GUIDE.md` details commands for 'Running GUM with In-Context Learning'.

Additionally, the integrated `Evaluate system for in-context learning` panel in `VS Code` actively diagnoses problems like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'` and is explicitly used by eyrink to ask, 'How can I verify that the nudge is taking in in context learning?'.

A right-hand panel titled \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" is visible, suggesting development related to AI/ML.\n*   **Receiving and Interacting with an AI Assistant:** The user receives an in-editor message from \"darynn\" asking \"How can I verify that the nudge is taking in in context learning?\". An AI assistant then processes this query, indicating \"Thought for 2s\", and subsequently suggests \"Creating a diagnostic script to verify in-context learning is working: \u2713 verify_icl.py\".\n*   **Observing Real-time LLM Decision Output:** Simultaneously, a console panel at the bottom displays a detailed \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" output. This output indicates that a notification `\u274c NO` was sent, providing metrics (Relevance, Importance, Urgency, Risk) and a textual explanation, concluding with \"REASON: COOLDOWN - LLM decided not to notify due to cooldown period\".",

The `main` branch is selected, and the file structure of the repository is displayed. The repository appears to contain Python files (`.py`), data files (`.json`), and compressed archives (`.zip`, `.lr`). The user is likely browsing the project's codebase or history.\n\n*   **Image 2:** The user has switched from the web browser to an IDE, which appears to be VS Code. A custom theme is active (\"customNudge\"). The IDE is showing various Python files open in tabs, suggesting an active development session. A file explorer on the left shows the project structure, with `customNudge` as the root. A console/terminal panel at the bottom displays `INFO` level logs, indicating processes related to observation, window management, and searching for \"eyrink\" (likely a reference to an AI model or entity). On the right, a sidebar titled \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" is open, presenting information about \"Changed made\" and \"Testing\" with bullet points.\n\n*   **Image 3:** In the VS Code environment, a chat window labeled \"darynne\" has appeared or become active within the \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" sidebar. A new message from \"darynne\" asks, \"How can I verify that the nudge is taking in in-context learning? While this is currently running.\" This indicates the user is interacting with an AI assistant or another collaborator within the IDE. The console output continues to show `INFO` messages, including \"Notification task started for nudge\" and further search operations.\n\n*   **Image 4:** The chat window now displays a response after a \"Thought for 2s\" period, suggesting the AI assistant is processing the query. The assistant has created a diagnostic script called `verify_icl.py`. Below the script, a panel titled \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" has appeared in the main editor area, detailing a decision not to notify, with relevance and urgency scores, and a reason: \"COOLDOWN - LLM decided not to notify due to cooldown period.\" The console continues to log `INFO` messages, including processing observation data and searching for propositions.\n\n*   **Image 5:** The chat interaction has progressed, and the AI assistant has provided command-line instructions (`chmod`, `cd`, `python3`) to run the `verify_icl.py` script. The script execution is shown with \"Ran command: chmod\" and \"Ran command: python3\". The output confirms that \"In-Context Learning Verification\" was successful. The \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" panel is still visible, showing the same cooldown reason. The console output continues to show `INFO` messages related to observation processing and searches.\n\n**Key User Actions:**\n\n*   **Browsing a GitHub repository:** The user is initially viewing the `kevinvzhu/betterZestimate` project files on GitHub.\n*   **Working in an IDE:** The user has opened a project in VS Code, with multiple Python files and a project explorer visible.\n*   **Reviewing console logs:** The user is monitoring `INFO` messages in the terminal, which are output from the running application or scripts.\n*   **Interacting with an AI assistant/chat:** The user (or the system) poses a question to \"darynne\" about verifying in-context learning, and then follows up by running a generated diagnostic script based on the assistant's instructions.\n*   **Observing AI/LLM decisions:** The user is viewing an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" panel, which provides insights into why a specific AI notification was not triggered, citing \"COOLDOWN.\"",

This is a ge`\n`riot of deep work and problem-solving, which should generally not be interrupted. A key guideline states: \"if the`\n`user is actively working on a task, then do not send notifications related to that task (i.e. the user is readi`\n`ng and debugging, or actively coding)\". Delivering a notification, furthermore, would have low practical appli`\n`cations been ineffective (0% effective), suggesting that the current approach or timing is not working. Sending`\n`a notification now would likely be redundant (as Claude just provided a fix) or disruptive during a critical thin`\n`king period.

While highly rel`\n`evant to the test of finishing homework projects and actionable, a key slack notification (\"AI has a fix! Run`\n`the GUI to test it & progress your homework project.\") was already sent by the system at 2:47 PM (after this obse`\n`rvation but before this decision point) and was ineffective.

The sequence illustrates monitoring system logs, receiving and responding to a query about in-context learning (ICL), and displaying diagnostic information.\n\nHere's a detailed description of the actions:\n\n**Image 1**: The user is viewing the console output panel, which displays numerous log messages related to system operations, including references to \"eyrink\" and \"nudge.\" Several file tabs are open, indicating a multi-file project. The right-hand panel is titled \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" and shows sections related to gRPPC suppression, parsing improvements, and testing.\n\n**Image 2**: A brief \"Hello!\" notification from \"darynne\" appears in the top-right corner of the screen, suggesting a message from another user or an automated system.\n\n**Image 3**: The previous \"Hello!\" notification is gone. A new chat notification from \"darynne\" appears, posing the question: \"How can I verify that the nudge is taking in in-context learning? While this is currently running.\" This indicates an active query about the system's behavior.\n\n**Image 4**: The main editor pane has changed from generic console output to display an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" from `lm_judge.py`. This decision explicitly states \"Should Notify: \u274c NO\" with reasons like \"COOLDOWN - LLM decided not to notify due to cooldown period.\" Simultaneously, the right-hand panel shows the system processing \"darynne's\" question, stating \"Creating a diagnostic script to verify in-context learning is working:\" and displaying a checkbox for `verify_icl.py`.\n\n**Image 5**: The main editor pane reverts to displaying system logs, including an `InterruptKeyboardError` and a \"System state captured successfully\" message. The right-hand panel now presents a comprehensive \"Summary\" of the in-context learning status, including \"ICL fields present,\" \"Examples pool growing,\" \"Examples being used,\" and \"Learning progression.\" It also provides \"Tips\" for understanding the ICL state and lists \"Monitors\" such as `monitor_icl_realtime.py`, effectively answering \"darynne's\" earlier question.\n\nHere are specific actions observed:\n\n*   The user is **monitoring console output** detailing the operations of an AI system, including specific mentions of \"eyrink\" and \"nudge\" components (Image 1, 5).\n*   A chat participant named 'darynne' **sends a query** through a built-in chat interface, asking for verification regarding the \"nudge\" system's use of in-context learning (Image 3).\n*   The user **observes an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\"**, which provides insight into the AI's reasoning for suppressing a notification due to a \"cooldown period\" (Image 4).\n*   The user **reviews the system's diagnostic response** to 'darynne's question, which includes a summary of in-context learning progress, relevant tips, and available monitoring scripts (Image 5).",

These logs detail various system operations, including processing observations and starting system state capture. A right-hand panel is visible, titled \"Evaluate system for in-context learning,\" which includes sections like \"GRPC suppression,\" \"Parsing improvements,\" and \"Testing,\" each with bullet points describing related functionalities or issues.\n\n*   **System Notification Decision (Image 2):** A new section, \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION,\" appears within the main log output area. This section provides details about a system's decision, stating \"Should Notify: \u274c NO\" with reasons related to relevance, effectiveness, urgency, and a cooldown period. This change indicates a system event related to notification logic that the user is now viewing.\n\n*   **Transition to In-Context Learning (ICL) Diagnostics (Image 3):** The right-hand panel undergoes a significant change, now focusing on \"in-context learning\" diagnostics. It displays a prompt \"How can I verify that the nudging is taking in in context learning? While this is currently running\" and details about \"Creating a diagnostic script to verify in-context learning is working,\" with a `verify_icl.py` checkbox. A \"Summary\" section outlines the status of ICL fields, example pools, and learning progression. The log panel continues to update with `INFO` messages, showing system state captures and nudge effectiveness evaluations.\n\n*   **Execution of an ICL Monitoring Script (Image 4):** The right-hand panel further updates to show the execution of a monitoring script. Under the `monitor_icl_realtime.py` section, a \"Run command: chmod\" entry is displayed, followed by the successful execution of `sudo sh /Users/eyrink/Documents/GitHub/customnudge/customnudge/monitor_icl_realtime.py`, indicated by a green checkmark. A \"HOW TO MONITOR_ICL_MD\" section also appears, suggesting documentation or further instructions. The log panel continues to show `INFO` messages about setting batch ready events and adding observations.\n\n**Specific User Actions (Inferred from visible changes):**\n\n*   The user is **monitoring system logs** related to observations, state capture, and nudge effectiveness.\n*   The user **reviewed a system's notification decision** for an LLM (Large Language Model) output, which was explicitly displayed in the logs.\n*   The user then **navigated to or initiated a diagnostic evaluation** specifically for \"in-context learning\" (ICL), as evidenced by the change in the right-hand panel's content.\n*   The user **executed a command to run an ICL monitoring script**, `monitor_icl_realtime.py`, as indicated by the command prompt and successful execution status in the right-hand panel.",

The screen is divided into several panels: a file explorer on the left, an editor area in the top center, an output/terminal panel in the bottom center, and a specialized \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel on the right.\n\n**Image 1:**\nThe initial state shows the `_llm_judge.py` file open in the editor. The bottom center panel is displaying \"Output\" logs, primarily \"INFO\" messages related to system initialization, processing updates, observation windows, and notification decisions, all timestamped around `2025-11-29 14:47:38`. The right panel presents an evaluation of \"gRPC Fork warnings\" and details recent \"Changes made\" to the system, specifically mentioning \"Response parsing improvements\".\n\n**Image 2:**\nA significant change occurs in the bottom center panel:\n*   **User Action:** The user has **switched from the \"Output\" tab to the \"Terminal\" tab** in the bottom center panel.\n*   **System Response:** The \"Terminal\" tab now displays an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\". This decision explicitly states \"Should Notify: NO\" with all relevance, effectiveness, urgency, and impact scores at \"0.0/10\", followed by a detailed explanation that a notification was not sent due to a \"cooldown period\".\n*   **System Response:** Concurrently, the right \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel has updated its content, presenting a new query: \"How can I verify that the nudge is taking in in context learning? While this is currently running\". It also indicates a \"Thought for 2s\" and suggests \"Creating a diagnostic script to verify in-context learning is working,\" with a checkbox next to `verify_icl.py`.\n\n**Image 3:**\nThe interaction continues with further updates to the panels:\n*   **System Activity:** The bottom center \"Terminal\" panel now shows a Python traceback originating from `T.join()` within a miniconda3 path, followed by a series of new \"INFO\" log messages. These logs continue to detail system events, processing updates, and observation captures, with timestamps around `2025-11-29 14:49:15` to `14:49:22`, indicating ongoing script execution.\n*   **User Interaction/System Response:** The right \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" panel has updated again. The question about verifying in-context learning remains at the top. Below it, an input field now contains \"head-#observation window\", suggesting either a user input or a system-generated prompt. New sections like \"Summary\", \"ICL fields present\", and \"Tips\" are visible, offering guidance on \"Examples used_count\", \"Check bucket matching\", and \"Effective examples need effectiveness_score\".\n*   **System Response:** A \"Run command\" section is now present, showing `monitor_icl_realtime.py` with a success checkmark, and a `chmod +x` command for `monitor_icl_realtime.py`, indicating a command has been executed successfully.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The user (or system) **switches the view in the bottom panel from \"Output\" logs to the \"Terminal\" view** (Image 1 to Image 2).\n*   The \"Terminal\" panel **displays a detailed LLM notification decision** indicating no notification due to cooldown (Image 2).\n*   The right \"Evaluate system...\" panel **updates with new questions and suggestions related to in-context learning verification and diagnostic scripts** (Image 1 to Image 2).\n*   The \"Terminal\" panel **shows ongoing script execution, including a Python traceback and subsequent INFO logs** (Image 2 to Image 3).\n*   The right \"Evaluate system...\" panel **updates further to show a summary, tips, and the successful execution of a monitoring command** (`monitor_icl_realtime.py`), with an input field displaying \"head-#observation window\" (Image 2 to Image 3).",

The workflow involves navigating code, reviewing console output, and consulting an AI assistant panel for guidance.\n\n**Detailed Description of Actions:**\n\n**Image 1:**\nThe user is initially viewing the Python file `llm_judge.py` in the main editor. Below the code, the \"Output\" tab of a console panel is active, displaying an \"LLM NOTIFICATION DECISION\" with details on relevance, urgency, impact, and a reason for \"COOLDOWN.\" Further down, log messages from `2025-11-29` are visible, indicating processes like \"processing batch of 15 observations.\" On the right, an AI assistant panel titled \"Evaluate system for in-context learning\" is open, showing a prompt and initial thoughts, including a checkbox for `verify_icl.py`.\n\n**Image 2:**\nThe user has switched the active file in the main editor from `llm_judge.py` to `cll.py`. The console's \"Output\" tab has updated, now displaying a `Traceback (most recent call last)` error related to `threading.py`, followed by new log messages indicating system state initialization, loading of the NudgeManager, and processing of notification decisions. The user has scrolled the console output to the top, indicated by \"1 / 18\" in the bottom right of the panel. On the right, the \"Summary\" section within the AI assistant panel has been expanded, providing more detailed information about ICL fields, examples, and learning progression, along with tips. A new section references `monitor_icl_realtime.py`.\n\n**Image 3:**\nThe user has expanded the \"HOW_TO_VERIFY_ICL_M\" folder in the file explorer and has opened the Markdown file `W_TO_VERIFY_ICL_M.md` in the main editor. This file contains instructions on \"How To Verify In-Context Learning is Working,\" including a recommended real-time monitor script (`monitor_icl_realtime.py`) and commands to execute it. The console output has updated again, showing new log entries from `2025-11-29` related to \"System state captured successfully,\" \"Setting batch ready event,\" and \"GETTING LLM JUDGMENT,\" consistent with a monitoring script's output. The AI assistant panel on the right has also updated, showing the command `monitor_icl_realtime.py` being referenced and a new section indicating content from the `W_TO_VERIFY_ICL_M.md` file.\n\n**Key User Actions:**\n\n*   The user **navigates between Python code files**, specifically switching from `llm_judge.py` to `cll.py`.\n*   The user **actively reviews log outputs in the console panel**, scrolling to the top to see recent messages, including a traceback.\n*   The user **interacts with the AI assistant panel** by expanding the \"Summary\" section to gain more context on in-context learning evaluation.\n*   The user **opens and views the `W_TO_VERIFY_ICL_M.md` Markdown file**, seemingly following instructions to verify in-context learning using a monitoring script.\n*   The user is **observing system output and AI assistant feedback** that suggests the `monitor_icl_realtime.py` script has been executed or is being referenced as part of the verification process.",
