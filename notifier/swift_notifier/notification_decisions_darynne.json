Sending a notification during an active, goal-aligned task would be disruptive rather than helpful, potentially breaking Darynne's focus.

Sending a notification now would likely be disruptive and is not necessary, as the observed behavior supports the user's goal rather than hindering it. The proposition of 'frequent context switching' is an inference, and this single switch does not indicate a problem warranting intervention.",
